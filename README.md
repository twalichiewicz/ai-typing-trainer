## üé® Customization

### Adding New Scenarios
Edit `scenarios.js` to add new training scenarios:

```javascript
{
    id: 11,
    title: "Your New Scenario",
    difficulty: "intermediate", // beginner, intermediate, advanced
    context: "Describe the working situation...",
    goal: "What needs to be accomplished...",
    badExample: "Poor prompt example",
    goodExample: "Excellent prompt with specifics",
    keywords: {
        specificity: ["technical", "terms", "here"],
        context: ["environment", "setup", "words"],
        constraints: ["requirement", "limitation", "words"],
        observability: ["outcome", "success", "measurement", "words"]
    },
    tips: [
        "Specific tip for this scenario",
        "Another helpful tip"
    ]
}
```

### Styling Customization
Modify CSS variables in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #4f46e5;    /* Main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #7c3aed;  /* Accent color */
    --success-color: #10b981;    /* Success feedback */
    --warning-color: #f59e0b;    /* Warning feedback */
    --danger-color: #ef4444;     /* Error feedback */
}
```

### Scoring Algorithm
Adjust scoring weights in `scenarios.js`:

```javascript
const SCORING_WEIGHTS = {
    specificity: 0.3,    // 30% of total score
    context: 0.25,       // 25% of total score
    constraints: 0.25,   // 25% of total score
    observability: 0.2   // 20% of total score
};
```
